    STICKY STORE

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Virtual Store For Virtual Stickers--

 If you enjoy collecting virtual items, this app is for you. 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------

Completely Free--

 The app is free of charge. But of course, it doesn't mean you get to have all the collectables just by downloading this app. What's the fun in acquiring collectables if there's no challenge?
 That is why we added a mini-game.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
MATHS--

 As mentioned above, the minigame acts as a challenge to the collector. 
 The minigame is a simple math game. You are given a math problem, and you write your answer. If you get it right, you get rewarded with coins. The amount of coins you get, depends on the difficulty of said problem.
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 	
Difficulty System--

 There are three stages of difficulty. The first level involves addition of numbers, the second _ subtraction, the third _ multiplication. 
 To advance in levels, you need to correctly answer 4 math problems on each.
 	
 -------------------------------------------------------------
 
 After going all this trouble, solving math problems, you deserve having your data stored.
 
 That brings us to the feature that greets you when you first open the app: Log in and registration.
 
 This widely-used feature is something we assume you are familiar with. Of course, we won't leave you hanging if you forget your password. It happens to the best of us! We added password-recovery and a "change your password" features, along with our contact information, if you need help personally. Just click "contact us" and you have our emails, phone numbers, and an address.
